## How To Use
- Place GummyWorms.dll in Plugins folder
- Click on any map, adjust the sliders and have fun! ^^
- **Number of Links:** 2 to 20
- **Squish Factor:** 0.05: links lie parallel to ground and worms are flat -> 1.0 links stand up and the worms are "round"
- Score submission in Solo is turned off if ScoreSaber is installed. Uninstalling SS will activate Solo scores
- Party and Multiplayer scores are not affected by SS installation 😁
- Requires: BS_Utils, BSML. BS 1.20.0+ only
