# Caterpillars Mod

**Now you can play Centipede, with real centipede links. Or 14-star Ov as Worm Curls.
Play any map as pseudo-chain-link poodles, flat worms, worm curls, helices and all sorts of generative hilarity. Supports Solo, Party, Multiplayer, OST/DLCs**

## How To Use
- Place Caterpillars.dll in Plugins folder
- Click on any map, adjust the sliders and have fun! ^^
- **Number of Links:** 2 to 20
- **Squish Factor:** 0.05: links lie parallel to ground and caterpillars are flat -> 1.0 links stand up and the caterpillars are "round"
- Score submission in Solo is turned off if ScoreSaber is installed. Uninstalling SS will activate Solo scores
- Party and Multiplayer scores are not affected by SS installation 😁
- Requires: BS_Utils, BSML. BS 1.20.0+ only

## About
A silly POC. There may be bugs (*cough*) 😂 Why did I make this? Because I could.
